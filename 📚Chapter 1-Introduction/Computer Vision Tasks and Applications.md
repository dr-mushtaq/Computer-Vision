### **1.1-Image Classification** 

Image classification is one of the main tasks in the field of computer vision [1].In this task, the trained model assigns a certain class to the image based on a predefined set of classes. The figure below is the famous CIFAR-10 dataset [1], which consists of 80 million images of ten classes. In the image classification task, the model is trained to assign the input image to one of the predefined ten classes, as shown in the figure below.
The computer analyzes an image in the form of pixels. It does it by considering the image as an array of matrices with the size of the matrix reliant on the image resolution. Put simply, image classification, in a computer‚Äôs view, is the analysis of this statistical data using algorithms. In digital image processing, image classification is done by automatically grouping pixels into specified categories, so-called classes. The algorithms segregate the image into a series of its most prominent features, lowering the workload on the final classifier. These characteristics give the classifier an idea of what the image represents and what class it might be considered into. The characteristic extraction process makes up the most important step in categorizing an image, as the rest of the steps depend on it.

**Image classification applications**:

There are a lot of real-world applications for image classification [1].

**Automated inspection and quality control**: Image classification can be used to automatically inspect products on an assembly line and identify those that do not meet quality standards.

**Classification of skin cancer**: Another application of image classification in the healthcare domain is automating the classifying of skin images into malignant and begin.

**Land use mapping**: Image classification can be used to automatically map land use and identify different land types.
**Security and Medical Imaging**: Finally, two more surveillance is a huge issue. This ideas of being able to monitor environment for crowd safety, a variety of reasons.

These are screenshots taken from Siemens sells a system for doing port monitoring.Just to know whether, say, people are loitering, or vehicles are approaching that aren't supposed to be. This is also a computer vision. A more direct effect on a single individual with computer vision is work in medical imagining. Okay, so here you see an example. There's all sorts of 3D imaging, MRI, CAT scan, stuff like that, but here you see some work.This came out of Eric Grimson's lab a while ago at MIT where on a screen, a the computer vision system is registering the skull that's on the table with a model that has been created from the 3D imaging. So while, when the surgeon looks at this monitor, he sees the real person, and by the way, if there were a scalpel here, he'd see the hand with the scalpel or drill or whatever you're using to make a hole in the person's head. And where the various structures are underneath that you wanted to see, and that's also computer vision.

 # **Object Identification**
As mentioned, image classification works by assigning classes or labels to the picture from a predefined set of labels, object identification recognizes specific instances of the class. For example the image classification tasks, the focus is to classify the face's pictures, in object identification, the focus is on identifying the person and recognizing them. Therefore, object detection can be seen as a clustering algorithm to cluster similar instances with each other.

## **Object Detection and Localization** 

Sometimes we also need to extract the location of an object that is present in the image. This is when we can use Object Detection, another well-known and useful Computer Vision task

Here instead of just the label, the system also provides you with bounding box coordinates to tell where exactly the object is located in the image.

###  **3-How does computer vision work**?
Computer vision technology tends to mimic the way the human brain works. But how does our brain solve visual object recognition? One of the popular hypothesis states that our brains rely on patterns to decode individual objects. This concept is used to create computer vision systems [5].Computer vision algorithms that we use today are based on pattern recognition. We train computers on a massive amount of visual data ‚Äî computers process images, label objects on them, and find patterns in those objects. For example, if we send a million images of flowers, the computer will analyze them, identify patterns that are similar to all flowers and, at the end of this process, will create a model ‚Äúflower.‚Äù As a result, the computer will be able to accurately detect whether a particular image is a flower every time we send them pictures.
Computer vision works in three basic steps:

1- **Acquiring an image**

Images, even large sets, can be acquired in real-time through video, photos or 3D technology for analysis.

2- **Processing the image**

Deep learning models automate much of this process, but the models are often trained by first being fed thousands of labeled or pre-identified images. Computer vision algorithms are based on pattern recognition. We train our model on a massive amount of visual(images) data. Our model processes the images with label and find patterns in those objects(images).

3- **Understanding the image**

The final step is the interpretative step, where an object is identified or classified.

###  Real life Example

For example, If we send a million pictures of vegetable images to a model to train, it will analyze them and create an Engine (Computer Vision Model) based on patterns that are similar to all vegetables. As a result, Our Model will be able to accurately detect whether a particular image is a Vegetables every time we send it .
