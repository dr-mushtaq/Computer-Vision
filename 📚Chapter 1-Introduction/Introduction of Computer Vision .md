 ## **Difference between CV and CP**
 
What is the difference between these two classes and the material covered in it? There is indeed some overlap between the classes, especially in the initial few modules where we learn about computing with images and extracting information from images.

Computational photography is really about capturing a light from a scene to record a scene into a photograph or such other related novel artifact that showcases the scene. Image analysis is done to support the capture and display of the scene in novel ways. Some of it's actually about building newer forms of cameras and softwares to facilitate that process. Computer vision is really about interpreting an analysis of the scene. That is what is the content of the image of the scene, who is in there, what is in the image and what is happening.

### **1- Introduction** 
This is a course on computer vision. It's aimed at covering the foundational aspects of how to analyze images and to extract content from images. That is, how can we build a computer or a machine that can see and interpret an image. First what do I mean by foundational? I mean that we are going to cover the mathematical and computational methods to provide you with core concepts of how can a computer be built to interpret images. Notice I am using the word interpret. In Computer Vision we are interested in extracting information, knowledge from an image. Many want to go beyond processing an image to really knowing what is inside the image, what's the content of the image. So we will learn the math and the basic concepts how to compute with an image and extract information from it.

### **2- What is Computer Vision** 

**Definition:** Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects — and then react to what they “see.”

**Defination1:** “Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do” 

**Definition 2** :“Computer Vision is just a field of AI that enables computers or machines to see and understand the world and the things in it” 

**Definition 3-GPT: Computer vision**  is a field of study in computer science and artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to interpret and understand visual data from the world around us. It involves developing algorithms and techniques that allow computers to analyze and make sense of images and videos, just like humans do.
