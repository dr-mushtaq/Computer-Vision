 ## **Difference between CV and CP**
 
What is the difference between these two classes and the material covered in it? There is indeed some overlap between the classes, especially in the initial few modules where we learn about computing with images and extracting information from images.

Computational photography is really about capturing a light from a scene to record a scene into a photograph or such other related novel artifact that showcases the scene. Image analysis is done to support the capture and display of the scene in novel ways. Some of it's actually about building newer forms of cameras and softwares to facilitate that process. Computer vision is really about interpreting an analysis of the scene. That is what is the content of the image of the scene, who is in there, what is in the image and what is happening.

 **1- Introduction** 
This is a course on computer vision. It's aimed at covering the foundational aspects of how to analyze images and to extract content from images. That is, how can we build a computer or a machine that can see and interpret an image. First what do I mean by foundational? I mean that we are going to cover the mathematical and computational methods to provide you with core concepts of how can a computer be built to interpret images. Notice I am using the word interpret. In Computer Vision we are interested in extracting information, knowledge from an image. Many want to go beyond processing an image to really knowing what is inside the image, what's the content of the image. So we will learn the math and the basic concepts how to compute with an image and extract information from it.
